# Changelog

All notable changes to the compound-wordpress-engineering plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- YAML crash: Quoted unquoted `argument-hint` values containing `[...]` brackets in `heal-skill`, `create-agent-skill` commands and `create-agent-skills` skill templates. Unquoted brackets are parsed as YAML arrays, causing crashes or silent data loss.
- Skill name mismatch: Changed `resolve-pr-parallel/SKILL.md` name field from `resolve_pr_parallel` (underscores) to `resolve-pr-parallel` (hyphens) to match directory name per skill compliance checklist.
- Added `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` to prevent orphan worktree directories from being committed accidentally.
- Added cross-platform LLM preamble to `setup` skill for compatibility with non-Claude LLM backends that lack `AskUserQuestion` support.
- Removed broken `skill: imgup` reference from `workflows:work` command — skill does not exist in plugin.
- Removed broken `/xcode-test` command references from `workflows:review` — command does not exist; iOS testing section removed as this is a WordPress-focused plugin.
- Fixed stale component counts in docs site CTA (was "29 agents, 17 skills" — now "30 agents, 22 skills").
- Updated docs site MCP Servers section from "1 MCP Server" to "2 MCP Servers" and added Playwright card.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- `wp-playground` skill — Start and manage WordPress Playground instances for local testing. Includes startup/stop/status scripts, blueprint patterns reference, and evaluation procedure for comparing Playground implementations.
- `wp-testing` skill — Scaffold and run WordPress test suites (PHPUnit, wp-browser, Playwright). Includes scaffold and run scripts, plus 4 reference docs: PHPUnit setup, test patterns, TDD workflow, and fixture patterns.
- `wp-phpcs` skill — Run PHP_CodeSniffer with WordPress Coding Standards. Includes setup and run scripts, plus phpcs.xml.dist configuration templates.
- `wp-phpstan` skill — Run PHPStan static analysis with WordPress extensions (`szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress`). Includes setup and run scripts, plus phpstan.neon configuration templates.
- `wp-eslint` skill — Run ESLint with `@wordpress/eslint-plugin`. Includes run script and .eslintrc.json configuration templates.
- `wp-test-reviewer` agent — Reviews test suites for isolation, meaningful assertions, security path coverage, integration patterns, naming conventions, and anti-patterns.
- Playwright MCP server — Browser automation for end-to-end testing, replaces agent-browser as the primary tool.

### Changed
- `wp-php-reviewer` agent — Added Step 0: runs PHPCS and PHPStan (if available) before prompt-based analysis, incorporating tool findings into review.
- `wp-javascript-reviewer` agent — Added Step 0: runs ESLint (if available) before prompt-based analysis, incorporating tool findings into review.
- `workflows:work` command — Added "Establish Testing Strategy" step in Phase 1 (scaffolds tests if none exist), added red/green TDD checkpoints in Phase 2 task loop, added test coverage row to System-Wide Test Check, updated Phase 4 screenshots to use Playwright MCP with agent-browser fallback.
- `workflows:review` command — Added Static Analysis Phase (detects and runs PHPCS/PHPStan/ESLint on changed files before agents), added Test Coverage Check (flags new features without tests), added wp-test-reviewer as conditional agent for PRs containing test files.
- `test-browser` command — Rewritten to use Playwright MCP as primary tool with agent-browser as fallback. Auto-detects server URL (WP Playground, wp-env, custom). Reads `test_server_url` from settings.
- `setup` skill — Added test environment detection (WP Playground, wp-env, Local/MAMP), static analysis tool detection (PHPCS, PHPStan, ESLint, PHPUnit), new questions in Customize path, extended `compound-engineering.local.md` output with `test_environment`, `test_server_url`, and `static_analysis` frontmatter fields.
- Plugin keywords — Added `testing`, `phpunit`, `phpcs`, `phpstan`, `static-analysis`, `playwright`. Removed `agent-browser`.

### Fixed
- Shell script security — Added PORT validation (numeric, 1-65535) to all playground scripts, replaced string-based command construction with array in `playground-start.sh`, sanitized `PROJECT_NAME` to alphanumeric/hyphens/underscores, added PID validation before `kill` in `playground-stop.sh`.
- Static analysis scripts — Changed `xargs` to `xargs -0` with `git diff -z` in `run-phpcs.sh`, `run-phpstan.sh`, and `run-eslint.sh` for safe filename handling.
- Duplicate static analysis — `wp-php-reviewer` and `wp-javascript-reviewer` Step 0 now skips tool execution when results are already provided by `workflows:review`.
- Playwright MCP version — Pinned to `@playwright/mcp@0.0.68` (was `@latest`).
- `scaffold-tests.sh` — `--type` parameter now produces differentiated scaffolding for plugin/theme/block (type-aware bootstrap.php and sample integration tests).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-22
