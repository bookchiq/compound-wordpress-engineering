# Compound WordPress Engineering Plugin Development

## Versioning Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Every change to this plugin MUST include updates to all three files:

1. **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** - Bump version using semver
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Document changes using Keep a Changelog format
3. **`README.md`** - Verify/update component counts and tables

### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major reorganization
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New agents, commands, or skills
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, doc updates, minor improvements

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing ANY changes:

- [ ] Version bumped in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
- [ ] README.md component counts verified
- [ ] README.md tables accurate (agents, skills)
- [ ] plugin.json description matches current counts

### Directory Structure

```
agents/
└── review/     # WordPress review agents (11) — all wp-* prefixed

skills/
└── wp-*/       # WordPress skills (7), each a directory with SKILL.md
```

This overlay ships **no commands** — workflow commands (`/plan`, `/review`, `/work`,
`/compound`, etc.) come from upstream `compound-engineering` under its `ce-*` namespace.

## Overlay discipline

Add WordPress-specific work only. If upstream already ships a generic version of an agent or
skill (under a `ce-*` name), do **not** re-vendor it here — keep this overlay limited to the
`wp-*` reviewers and skills plus WordPress-native reviewers upstream has no equivalent for.

## Skill Compliance Checklist

When adding or modifying skills, verify compliance with skill-creator spec:

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)

- [ ] `name:` present and matches directory name (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- [ ] `description:` present and describes **what it does and when to use it** (per official spec: "Explains code with diagrams. Use when exploring how code works.")

### Reference Links (Required if references/ exists)

- [ ] All files in `references/` are linked as `[filename.md](./references/filename.md)`
- [ ] All files in `assets/` are linked as `[filename](./assets/filename)`
- [ ] All files in `scripts/` are linked as `[filename](./scripts/filename)`
- [ ] No bare backtick references like `` `references/file.md` `` - use proper markdown links

### Writing Style

- [ ] Use imperative/infinitive form (verb-first instructions)
- [ ] Avoid second person ("you should") - use objective language ("To accomplish X, do Y")

### Quick Validation Command

```bash
# Check for unlinked references in a skill
grep -E '`(references|assets|scripts)/[^`]+`' skills/*/SKILL.md
# Should return nothing if all refs are properly linked

# Check description format - should describe what + when
grep -E '^description:' skills/*/SKILL.md
```
