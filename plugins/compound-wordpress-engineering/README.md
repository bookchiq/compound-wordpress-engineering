# Compound WordPress Engineering Plugin

AI-powered WordPress development tools that get smarter with every use. Make each unit of engineering work easier than the last.

Forked from [EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin). Preserves the four-stage compounding loop (Plan, Work, Review, Compound) while replacing framework-specific components with WordPress equivalents.
